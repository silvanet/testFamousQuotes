This solution to the FreeCodeCamp Random Quote Generator challenge
was inspired by Gordana Minovska's Github repository and documentation of her work in her Medium article. I contacted the
developer of the Andrux api and Gordana. She offered terrific advice and guidance for which I am most grateful. Thanks to her, I learned a whole lot that I didn't know before about debugging javascript code with the developer console tools.

Gordana re-wrote her code to adjust to the api change, but sent me a spoiler alert in advance. Her astute observation caught the square brackets in the console XHR response that pointed me to where my code was failing. I did a lot of research on this project and worked it out by myself. I can't thank Gordana enough for her kind response and assistance.
